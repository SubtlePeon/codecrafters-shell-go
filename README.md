<!-- This is a starting point for Go solutions to the -->
<!-- ["Build Your Own Shell" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/shell/overview). -->
<!---->
<!-- In this challenge, you'll build your own POSIX compliant shell that's capable of -->
<!-- interpreting shell commands, running external programs and builtin commands like -->
<!-- cd, pwd, echo and more. Along the way, you'll learn about shell command parsing, -->
<!-- REPLs, builtin commands, and more. -->
<!---->
<!-- **Note**: If you're viewing this repo on GitHub, head over to -->
<!-- [codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io) to try the challenge. -->
<!---->
<!-- # Passing the first stage -->
<!---->
<!-- The entry point for your `shell` implementation is in `cmd/myshell/main.go`. -->
<!-- Study and uncomment the relevant code, and push your changes to pass the first -->
<!-- stage: -->
<!---->
<!-- ```sh -->
<!-- git add . -->
<!-- git commit -m "pass 1st stage" # any msg -->
<!-- git push origin master -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!---->
<!-- Time to move on to the next stage! -->
<!---->
<!-- # Stage 2 & beyond -->
<!---->
<!-- Note: This section is for stages 2 and beyond. -->
<!---->
<!-- 1. Ensure you have `go (1.19)` installed locally -->
<!-- 1. Run `./your_shell.sh` to run your program, which is implemented in -->
<!--    `cmd/myshell/main.go`. -->
<!-- 1. Commit your changes and run `git push origin master` to submit your solution -->
<!--    to CodeCrafters. Test output will be streamed to your terminal. -->

# Codecrafters "Shell" Challenge
Written in Go (to learn). As of June 21st, 2024, this code completes all the tasks (as the challenge is still in beta). There are some improvements to be made still.

Will come back to this after I do some other challenges.
